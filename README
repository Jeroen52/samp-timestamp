DESCRIPTION
-----------

I was looking for a way to automatically include and define the build timestamp in a compilation of a gamemode.
So I copied most of my samp-git-hash project and changed it to print timestamps instead.

OVERVIEW
--------

samp-timestamp:

samp-timestamp:
	The binary that generates the include for Pawn.
	
DEPENDENCIES
------------

As far as I am aware, there are no dependencies.

BINARIES
--------

There are compiled binaries available for Windows operating systems.
It is very easy to compile this for Linux, but there is no official SA:MP Pawn compiler for Linux.

INSTALLATION
------------

Compile:
	samp-timestamp.c
		Using GCC: gcc samp-timestamp.c -o samp-timestamp
		Using Makefile: make
		
Alternative:
	It is possible to install the program on CentOS 6 and 7 using the RPM packages below or after configuring YUM with the repository below. The program can be accessed after installing using 'samp-timestamp'.
